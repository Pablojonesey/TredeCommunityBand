			<p id="p1"> The Tredegar Community Band are comprised of players at all levels of experience, ranging from new to experienced players who have played for many years.   We rehearse each Tuesday from 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm at the Alwyn Powell (Tredegar Town) Band Hall, address below. We have some spare cornets, tenor horn and brass instruments that you can use and it won't cost you a penny!. </p>

Even if you have not played a brass instrument previously, we can coach you to a level sufficient to play in the band.
